# priors
Non-informative priors in hydrologic applications

The goal of this project is to develop priors for Bayesian analysis in hydrologic modeling. The main focus of this study is to develop
objectively non-informative priors. First task is to assess the suitability of Bernardo's prior (Bernardo, 1979) as objective prior in
hydrologic modeling.

Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
Prerequisites

all the code has been written on MATLAB 2014a.

Give examples

Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

Give the example

And repeat

until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

Give an example

And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

Give an example
